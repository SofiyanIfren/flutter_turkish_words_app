# Learn Turkish (flutter_turkish_words_app)

## Presentation

An Opensource mobile application project to help french (and english) speakers to learn turkish, with 3 main functionnalities :

1. 1000+ words added on the main screen, with search mode included
2. Past, present and future tense for 48 verbs to get all different conjugation forms
3. Main turkish rules (in french langage)

A hourly notification is settled on the **feature/notification** branch, to give a new word and meaning at each time. You can change word langage and notification rate by editing *main.dart* and *services/notification_service.dart* files.

## Getting Started

Clone repository and, from root folder :
